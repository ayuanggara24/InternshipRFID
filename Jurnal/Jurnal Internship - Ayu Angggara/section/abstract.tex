RFID technology is an automatic wireless identification system that works with the help of active and passive cards as well as with the reader. The use of unique numbers inside RFID tags is very useful as the identity of an object or as a tracking device. As for weaknesses in RFID systems, it is possible to cloning identification data. Therefore it is necessary to increase security to minimize it. Authentication is the process of user verification. The most common form of Authentication is single-factor Authentication, which requires only one factor for users to log in to the system. This model is weak and can cause harm to those who use it. Therefore Multi-factor Authentication is required that is the way to authenticate users by using multiple layers of Authentication program. The factor to be used in this report is to use One-Time Password. With the system with several steps of this authentication can also minimize the fraud that will occur. As the proxy case absent and minimize the occurrence of duplication of RFID card
