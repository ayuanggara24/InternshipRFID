RFID-based authentication has been implemented and proven in this paper. RFID can be disposed as a communication system that provides a low response rate. Therefore we need additional Authentication that is Multi-Factor Authentication by applying system One-Time Password and User Account in the form of Username and Password. Using the Multi-Factor Authentication method will make the data more secure and minimize the fraud that occurs and minimize the occurrence of duplication of RFID card.
