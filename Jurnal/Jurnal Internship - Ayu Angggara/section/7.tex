Based on the results of experiments that have been done show that, by utilizing the method of Multi-Factor Authentication to make the existing system becomes more secure by performing several steps of authentication. Each user has a card each and on the card has different IDs. Every day while tapping, users will get an OTP Authentication code. The code will be sent to each user account. The OTP code will be used at home from work. Users will tapping and entering the code that has been sent. If the code is appropriate then the data will be updated and stored into the data base. But if it is wrong then the data will not be stored, and will be rejected by the system. Likewise when the card used is not registered in the database. System can be accessed through IP that has been provided. So with the system by using some steps of this authentication can minimize the occurrence of duplication of RFID card and minimize the occurrence of cheating that will happen later.
